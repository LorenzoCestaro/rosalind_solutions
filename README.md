# rosalind_solutions

This is a repository with my personal solutions to some of the Rosalind problems.
Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving. You can find more about it at www.rosalind.info

This repository is a collection of python scripts, and a work in progress. Many scripts depend on one another and not all of them are well written/thoroughly commented.
